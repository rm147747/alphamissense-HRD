## Overview

**AlphaHRD** is a three-layer computational framework for interpreting HRR missense variants of uncertain significance, combining pathogenicity prediction with allele-specific LOH and genomic scar characterization. We benchmarked four predictors (AlphaMissense, REVEL, CADD, PrimateAI) against overall survival within germline-enriched HRR genes across 31 TCGA pan-cancer types.

## Key Findings

| Finding | Value |
|---------|-------|
| ClinVar concordance (κ) | 0.733 (CI 0.712–0.754) |
| VUS reclassified | 90.1% (66,912 / 74,246) |
| **Concordant pathogenic (AM + REVEL) HR** | **0.563 (0.390–0.814, p = 0.002)** |
| AM within-germline HR | 0.646 (0.467–0.893, p = 0.008) |
| REVEL within-germline HR | 0.679 (0.523–0.882, p = 0.004) |
| Gene-stratified HR (within-gene effect) | 0.644 (p = 0.013) |
| E-value (concordance) | 2.95 (CI bound 1.76) |
| Stratified Cox HR (pan-cancer) | 0.848 (0.716–1.005, p = 0.057) |
| Biallelic vs monoallelic HRDsum | 27.0 vs 11.0 (p = 4.6 × 10⁻⁹) |
| Purity-filtered HR (≥ 0.5) | 0.699 (p < 0.001) |
| Tumors analyzed | 31 TCGA PanCancer Atlas |
| Patients | 1,939 (1,883 with OS) |
| Variants | 4,301 HRR missense |

## Central Result

Within germline-enriched HRR genes (BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2), patients classified as pathogenic by **both** AlphaMissense and REVEL had the strongest survival association (HR = 0.56, p = 0.002). When the two predictors disagreed, neither group reached significance. Cross-predictor concordance defines the clinically informative VUS subset.

CADD trended without significance (p = 0.09). PrimateAI did not discriminate (p = 0.53).

## Pipeline

```
Layer 1: Pathogenicity classification
         AlphaMissense (≥0.564) + benchmark vs REVEL (≥0.5), CADD (≥25), PrimateAI (≥0.803)
         → Concordance analysis: AM × REVEL agreement

Layer 2: Allele-specific LOH (ASCAT3)
         → Biallelic vs monoallelic classification

Layer 3: Genomic scar characterization
         → HRDsum (LOH + TAI + LST) + SBS3 signatures
         → Five-tier classification (biological characterization)
```

## Sensitivity Analyses

| # | Analysis | Result |

| 2 | RMST | +3.1 to +5.8 months (all p < 0.01) |
| 3 | Purity filter | HR strengthens: 0.80 → 0.70 |
| 4 | E-value | Concordance: 2.95 (CI 1.76); Pan-cancer: 1.64 (CI 1.00) |
| 5 | BRCA1 methylation | Independent (OR ≈ 1.0, p = 0.66) |
| 6 | TMB + immune | TMB 3× higher; immune infiltrate identical |
| 7 | Stage-adjusted Cox | HR = 0.87 (p = 0.16) |

## Important Limitations

- ATM concentrates the within-germline signal (excluding ATM: p = 0.24)
- Concordance analysis was added during pre-submission audit, not pre-specified
- AlphaMissense does not predict HRD status independently
- TCGA is treatment-naive; PARPi-treated validation needed
- Five-tier classification is biological characterization, not a validated prognostic tool
- TRUE_HRD subgroup (n = 37) is underpowered for survival analysis

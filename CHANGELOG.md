### New Analyses (8 Robustness Suite)
- **Notebook7_Extended_Robustness.py**: 5 new sensitivity analyses
  - 7.1 Germline vs Somatic: HR=0.62 (p<0.001) for germline BRCA1/2/ATM/PALB2/CHEK2
  - 7.2 Stage-adjusted Cox: HR attenuates to 0.87 (p=0.16), delta=3.1%
  - 7.3 RMST at 3 tau: +3.1 to +7.3 months survival difference, all p<0.01
  - 7.4 Purity filter: HR strengthens monotonically 0.80→0.70 with increasing purity
  - 7.5 E-value: 1.80 (CI bound 1.31) for baseline HR
- **Notebook8_BRCA1_Methylation.py**: BRCA1 promoter methylation (Layer 2B)
  - 3 CpG probes (cg13601799, cg08047457, cg19531713) from 450K array via Xena API
  - 85.4% overlap (1,608/1,883 patients)
  - BRCA1 methylation independent of AM status (OR=0.91-1.27)
- **Notebook9_TMB_Immune_FoldX.py**: TMB, immune infiltrate, FoldX preparation
  - Thorsson 2018 integration: 64 immunogenomic features, 83.6% overlap
  - TMB 3x higher in AM-pathogenic (tautological); immune infiltrate identical
  - FoldX script + 27 interface variant inputs ready for local execution

### New Data Files

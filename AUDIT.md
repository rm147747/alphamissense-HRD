# Audit Trail — AlphaHRD Repository

This document provides a complete audit trail for the AlphaHRD project.

## Key Statistical Decisions (with justification)

### 1. Germline-gene proxy (NB7, Analysis 1)
**Decision:** Use gene identity (BRCA1/2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2) as proxy for germline origin.
**Justification:** TCGA PanCan Atlas does not reliably separate germline from somatic calls in all tumor types. These 5 genes have >80% germline origin in the Huang et al. (Cell 2018) TCGA germline analysis. This is a conservative proxy; some somatic variants in these genes will be misclassified as germline.
**Alternative tested:** None available without controlled germline data.
**Impact if wrong:** Would dilute the germline signal toward null, making our estimate conservative.

### 2. Stage adjustment with complete-case analysis (NB7, Analysis 2)
**Decision:** Complete-case analysis (patients with available stage data only).
**Justification:** 30% of patients lack AJCC stage data. Multiple imputation was considered but not pursued because (a) the primary analysis is associative, not causal, (b) the missing mechanism may be MNAR (some tumor types do not use AJCC staging), and (c) the complete-case sensitivity analysis is more conservative.
**Impact:** Reduced sample size (1,883 → 1,311) widened confidence intervals and contributed to loss of significance. The HR direction was preserved (0.87 < 1.0).

### 3. RMST truncation points (NB7, Analysis 3)
**Decision:** Three tau values: 60 months (5 years, clinical standard), 81 months (90th percentile of observed follow-up), 120 months (10 years).
**Justification:** Multiple tau values demonstrate robustness across follow-up horizons. The 90th percentile avoids extrapolation beyond observed data. Pre-specified, not selected post-hoc.

### 4. Purity thresholds (NB7, Analysis 4)
**Decision:** Four thresholds: 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5.
**Justification:** Progressive filtering from liberal (0.2, loses 25 patients) to restrictive (0.5, loses 547 patients). Demonstrates dose-response relationship between purity and signal strength.

### 5. BRCA1 methylation probes (NB8, Analysis 6)
**Decision:** Three probes (cg13601799, cg08047457, cg19531713) averaged for composite promoter methylation score.
**Justification:** cg13601799 is the most cited BRCA1 promoter probe in the literature. The other two are adjacent CpGs in the same promoter region. Averaging reduces noise from individual probe outliers.
**Threshold:** Beta > 0.2 (moderate), > 0.3 (specific). Both reported.

### 6. Thorsson data version (NB9, Analysis 8)
**Decision:** Used Thorsson et al. 2018 Table S1 (64 features, CIBERSORT fractions).
**Justification:** This is the canonical TCGA pan-cancer immune landscape resource. The 2019 erratum corrected minor errors but did not change the immune subtype classifications or CIBERSORT estimates.

## Negative and Null Findings (explicitly documented)

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|------------|
| Stage adjustment attenuates HR to 0.87 (p=0.16) | Confounding by stage is real |
| E-value = 1.80 (CI bound 1.31) | Moderate robustness to unmeasured confounding |
| BRCA1 methylation does not differ by AM group | Pipeline captures different HRD pathway |
| No immune infiltrate difference (CD8, M1, M2, Tregs) | HRR status ≠ immune response in untreated cohort |
| Immune subtype similar (p=0.053) | No immune phenotype difference |
| Somatic-only carriers: HR=0.91 (p=0.33) | No survival benefit for somatic HRR variants |
| mCRPC validation: opposite direction (HR=1.15) | Referral bias in advanced cohort |
